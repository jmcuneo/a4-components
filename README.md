I recreated the code I did for A2 using Svelte. It is a virtual postcard designer with a WPI theme. I took the importunity to improve the aesthetic of the final postcard a bit and make the designer itself more compact so more thing can fit on the screen.

## Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
### I believe that everything was simpler this time around since Svelte provides a good base for building apps with non-persistent data (since the assingment instructions said "re-implement the client side portion of either A2 or A3", which it's why I went with Svelte). Testing was super easy, I just ran "npm run dev" and it ran as localhost, I saved each time a made a change, and the change was reflected immediatly. Therefore, adding this to Glitch was quite easy. I had some issues getting the page to load on Glitch however, so I went through a lot of trial and error to get it to work and thankfuly it finally ran.

I used the project tempalte from Svelte to get the baseline files.
It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

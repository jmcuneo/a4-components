Assignment 4 - Components
===

For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of *either* A2 or A3 using either React or Svelte components. If you choose A3 you only need to use components for the data display / updating; you can leave your login UI as is.

[Svelte Tutorial](https://github.com/jmcuneo/cs4241-guides/blob/master/using.svelte.md)  
[React Tutorial](https://github.com/jmcuneo/cs4241-guides/blob/master/using.react.md)  

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku, etc.). However, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them.

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Implement your project with the above requirements.
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page on Glitch/Heroku/etc., it displays correctly.
4. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a4-firstname-lastname` so we can find it.
5. Fork this repository and modify the README to the specifications below. Be sure to add *all* project files.
6. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Name the pull request using the following template: `a4-firstname-lastname`.

## Simple To-Do List, Using Svelte!

For this project I re-implemented my submission for Assignment 2 using Svelte components. Overall I found that the new technology did improve the development experience. I initially had some difficulties trying to figure out how to get the project set up, especially with getting the server set up properly alongside it. However, once I got past that I found Svelte very easy to work with. I've used React a few times for my other courses this year so I already have some familiarity with component-based JavaScipt frameworks, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much more I liked Svelte after being introduced to it through this assignment. I found Svelte a lot more intuitive and I really enjoyed the quality of life features it offers (e.g. how simple it is to create DOM elements from an array using an #each loop).

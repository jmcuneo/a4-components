## To Not-Do List

User manages a list of tasks they don't want to do. User can add/edit/delete tasks.

I used Svelte instead of vanilla HTML/JS. I built off of mainly assignment 2 but merged the express back-end and some improvements from assignment 3, which was challenging but worked out well.

Svelte was slightly challenging to set up and I also haven't used Vite too much before. Once I got the development environment working, Svelte significantly improved the development experience. Svelte has a compiler so it has lots of custom syntax and is so much simpler than React or vanilla JS. There is much less boilerplate. I will definitely be using Svelte in the future.

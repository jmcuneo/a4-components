## Simple To-Do List, Using Svelte!

http://a4-parkerfrizzle.glitch.me

For this project I re-implemented my submission for Assignment 2 using Svelte components. Overall I found that the new technology did improve the development experience. I initially had some difficulties trying to figure out how to get the project set up, especially with getting the server set up properly alongside it. However, once I got past that I found Svelte very easy to work with. I've used React a few times for my other courses this year so I already have some familiarity with component-based JavaScript frameworks, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much more I liked Svelte after being introduced to it through this assignment. I found Svelte a lot more intuitive and I really enjoyed the quality of life features it offers (e.g. how simple it is to create DOM elements from an array using an #each loop).

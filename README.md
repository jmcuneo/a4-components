I am unable to host my website, my program uses dependencies that require node v18.13 and above and Glitch only seems to support node 16 and under. I also tried to use Netlify and it did nork their either. I have tried for a long time to host the program and it just wont budge. My program works perfectly fine locally and i have included the link to a video where I host my program locally my Github code fro push "edit functionality added" and hsoting locally and testing my entire front end to showcase that my code works. Sorry, with all of the package edits to try to get Glitch to work, it messed up my local hosting. Therefore I had to go back a couple pushes. NO LOGIC CODE WAS CHANGED FROM THAT 'edit functionality added' CODE TO THE CURRENT CODE IN THIS PUSH. Thank you!

Here is the link to the local demo video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lnquavc-16GQ3dV5OzeqrLMUhfSxP_yo/view?usp=share_link


# Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

For me the Svelte technology improved my expirence, it required my to reqork a lot of my html structure and the rearranging of client-side code into a .svelte file. Though the Svelte package includes lots of handing syntax that makes it eay to have buttons that map to a function and have that all inside the App.svelte file which made things a lot easier. Also I like that my HTML is simplier now that some of it was moved to the App.svelte file. Also, onMount() made it easy for me to pass it my update table function to refresh the page after each action with a button.

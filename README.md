## Medical Application Form

https://a4-oliviaperez.glitch.me

My project is a sample Medical Application form. I recreated the UI with React and it was very interesting. I had tried to teach myself React before
but had struggled, but attempted to try again through this assignment. I remade the project using a fresh React project template and transferred my A2 
files over. I was struggling to re-connect the new jsx to the server, something I didn't think about too much before moving the project to Glitch. However, 
the jsx is working on my local machine. I do like React, and I thought it was fun to play with the new frontend and clientside possibilities, but 
connecting a fresh project to the server was definitely the hardest part.

In this assignment, I converted my A2 application to use React. To do this, I installed React and npx. I created a new React page with npx and inserted my client code and HTML into App.js. Then I made a server folder with my server code and rewrote some code to use express which made some of the logic and handiling of http requests easier to understand and shorter. Overall I see the benefits to have the code be produced through JavaScript but at times it did hinder me as I am learning this for the first time and it can get confusing with many libraries and frameworks.

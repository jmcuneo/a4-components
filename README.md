For this assignment, I decided to redesign my website using the Svelte web framework, which ultimately felt a bit more inhibiting than using no framework. For example, I found myself struggling to recreate actions that I had already done once before in pure Javascript, which I think dappens the usefulness of the framework. If I were to start a completely new web app by myself, I would definitely choose to use a framework like Svelte, but for implmentation into a pre-exisiting app, it makes things unneccessarily difficult.

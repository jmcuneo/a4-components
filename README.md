## What To Bring

http://a4-noracleary.glitch.me

I changed my assignment 3 code to dynmaically implement the table from the inputted data using Svelte. In assingment 3, I had to use querySelectors and save each value into a variable, the use these variables to insert HTML. With Svelte I was able to simply insert HTML directly, reducing a lot of code, as I no longer needed a lot of my variable and my table generating functions. I also got rid of event listeners, which I previously used to get the index of the button clicked and removed the element based on this index. Using Svelte, I attatched an ID to each element and dynamically removed the element based on the ID number, which reduced a lot of errors in conflicting event listeners and incorrect indeces.
While directly adding user input to the table was much easier using Svelte, it was challenging to learn the syntax and functionalities, especially while using async functions. With more practice Svelte would definitely help the development experience, however, I the syntax is not intuitive and can often get confusing, which hurt me a lot during this assignment.

## A4- GPA Calculator  

https://a4-erakalaja-old.glitch.me/

This project is a variation of the GPA calculator I've been using for both A2 and A3, but this version mainly uses the same frameworks I used in A3 excluding the user login since that did not need to be redesigned in react. This application will store and keep all updates to the website regardless of the userID (since it is not connected to github it does not track userID), and it maintains state using react functionality and mongoDB as the persistent data storage source. Once all associated fields in the calculate section are filled in, the calculate button will be clicked to add a class to the users table entries and recalculate their GPA. Once all associated fields in the delete section are filled in, the delete button will be clicked to delete a class from the users table entries and recalculate their GPA. Once all associated fields in the modify section are filled in, the modify button will be clicked to modify a class in the users table entries and recalculate their GPA. 

The new technology made this project harder at first due to the learning curve required to get started. But once I got a better understanding of how react works it really helped me streamline the client side process and condensed the amount code necessary from the client side. Overall, my development experience was made easier given the use of component programming in React. Furthermore, the ability to return an html div from a componenet enhanced my development experience as it cut out the unnecessary time that usually went into creating an html element from js.

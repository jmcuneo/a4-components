# Assignment 4 (Ad Hoc Hour Logging System) - Spencer Greene

Access at: [https://a4-spencergreene.onrender.com/ ](https://a4-spencergreene.onrender.com/)

A simple system to log hours for independent contract work. From A3:

> I was inspired to rewrite A2 to have a more practical application - a Time Entry system. Since my senior year in high school, I have interned with a medical firm, Sheard & Drugge. Over time, I got rather lazy manually logging my hours in an excel spreadsheet. This solution is a much more effective and efficient solution to create hour logging

A4 expands on A3 by using Svelte for rendering, rather than Handlebars. No additional changes were made.

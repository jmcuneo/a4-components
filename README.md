For this proect, I adjusted my A2 to use react components. I reformated my HTML to be in a return of the app.js file where my main doe is within a component. I also updated my server to use express. 

To breakdown the changes:

* React 
 Due to using react, I ran into some issues when trying to run my program. The issue was, running locally was fine, but I had to run the server and client side code seperately but figuring out how I could link these to run at the same itme was challanging. To get this to work, I had to use new packages they I ran into troubles with. However, I believe I just set this up imporperly since it was being built off of an old project since when I had made a react app in the past, I was able to run both the client and server at the same time. 
    * Overall I believe I prefer working with React since I like having the html linked to the javascript within the same file.

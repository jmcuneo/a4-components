## Shrimple To-Do List

http://a4-darrenni.glitch.me

I was able to reimplement my client-side code to Svelte. It took some time for me to learn the concepts and best practices, but once I got that down the convenience it brought was worth it. I was able to implement the same thing with less, and more easily understandable code.

On another note, Svelte uses ES modules by default. This is perfectly fine when running the server on my laptop, but Glitch doesn't recognize it so I had to use "require" instead of "import" for express. There are probably better ways to do this but I happen to like shrimple solutions so I didn't pursue them. 

On a second note I forgot to build my project so I was sitting there for five minutes wondering why my screen was blank. `npm run build` is my best friend...

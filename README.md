Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

My program runs user submitted code in a isolated vm and returns the result to the user. I changed my a3 project to use svelte and vite. I also changed my server to use modules. The https is now done through a proxy server.

I think if I understood how svelte worked and built my project for it originally it would have improved the developer experience. However trying to adapt a already working project to it defintely hindered my expereince. I could not figure out how to have mutliple pages and I dont think it should have been so hard to. Though I do like the minifing that the compiler does.

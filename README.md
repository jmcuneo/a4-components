##1RM Calculator

http://147.182.248.192:3000/

This project is a training logger that allows the user to calculate their potential one rep max. It is similar to my assignment #2 and #3. I eseentially removed the table since it is not requirement by the course, but kept the entry tables from assignment #3. This portrays all the data from the database, and the user can delete any selected entries. Since there is no login, the default user is "Edison Zhang". The new technology did improve and hinder the development experience. It was interesting to learn about react, but the time it took to learn how react functions and getting comfortable with using it took a long time. Also, glitch was not deploying my project.

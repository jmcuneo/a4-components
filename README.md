Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
Initailly, converting the old project to a react project was very challening. I had to create a new react project from scratch and then ciopy files over from the old project. This led to a lot of errors. I had many issues with the react project using ES modules. I had to change evryhwere I used "require" to import to resolve those errors. The backend code was mostly good to go, all the changes I needed to make were on the front end. I had to learn how to both host the server on the 3000 port and then run the app on another port and have them work together. It took a while to convert the front end code to use react and components, but once I did, I saw how the structure is much cleaner and easier to use. useState was very helpful for updating values. I can see that for a larger project having componets that could be easily-reused would be helpful. I think this development experience would be better than the old when starting from scratch, but converting from one to another was a bit of a headache.

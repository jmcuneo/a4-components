## Todo List in React

[https://a4-alexanderbeck.onrender.com/](https://a4-alexanderbeck.onrender.com/)

Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

I had a LOT of fun transferring this project into React. I ported most of the frontend over, and learned how to host everything without CDNs (for the most part). This new technology both improved and hindered my experience. It improved it because for certain features, such as creating new elements, it was SUPER fast and simple. It hindered it because whenever I wanted to make a change, I had to rebuild my project (though, as I was finishing up with no more code to write, I accidentally came across a way to not require me to do so). The way that states worked also made things difficult, though after I figured out how to use refs it wasn't too bad.

# Svelte implementation of A2

## What I did:

I used Svelte in order to recreate my A2 page. I felt that Svelte was intuitive when writing the pages, but it took wrapping my mind around the developer experience, since it wasn't just "place html file in /public". The provided tutorial wasn't helpful as it never specified how to actually run svelte with express, i.e. how to compile and serve with more advance type applications--that's why I'm not redoing A3, as it seems routing is done client side which I just hate. It seems like sveltekit might be a little better in this regard, but I don't want to learn another system with limited time. Also, component libraries are a pain and that further drove me to just simplify and do A2 as I had limited time, although I did use a table component. The state management was nice, though.

I did some other simple styling to center everything and give space. The results section also persists across reloads.

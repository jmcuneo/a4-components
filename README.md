*Was not able to implement to glitch as I couldn't get it to display properly

I updated the client side "js/main.js" to use React, and used babel to compile the code to dist/main.js to be able to display it.
However, when trying to get it to properly display in index.html, then I would keep getting errors, that when fixed would send another error and when that one was fixed, 
the initial error would happen again.

I definitely think that the new technology would probably improve the development experience. However, because I was changing already finished code to implement React rather 
than starting from scratch, then I might have gotten something confused, or maybe the build was incorrect and that ended up hindering this assignment for me

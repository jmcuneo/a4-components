Unlike previous assignments, this assignment will be solely graded on whether or not you successfully complete it. Partial credit will be generously given.

## Changes

### Server
- Changed server to use ViteExpress along with Express
- Had to change all `require` lines to `import`s
- Had to change how createTable sent data to the client

### Client
- Had to move and edit recipes.html to fit in App.svelte
- Had to move and edit all functions from main.js to App.svelte to conform with how Svelte handles button presses
- Had to change on-click function formatting for buttons
- Had to change how table is rendered in App.svelte to match Svelte's reactive programming
- Had to edit css files slightly to address new nesting of HTML elements

### New Technology

*Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?*

Using the new technology both helped and hindered my development experience. Vite was quite useful as it automatically updated my site without having to do anything. Unfortunately, I had a lot of trouble getting my site on a hosting service. I was unfamiliar with how building worked with Vite and Svelete and how the file directory was supposed to look.

For this assignment, I decided to redesign my website using the Svelte web framework, which ultimately felt a bit more inhibiting than using no framework. For example, when generating my table element dynamically based on the elements delievered from the database, I struggled very heavily on passing data between the `html` section and the `script` section such as id values and cell values, which made it seem like creating the element myself in JavaScript would have been easier. I found myself struggling to recreate actions that I had already done once before in pure Javascript, such as the table generation as well as my login page, which I think dappens the usefulness of the framework. If I were to start a completely new web app by myself, I would definitely choose to use a framework like Svelte, but for implmentation into a pre-exisiting app, it makes things unneccessarily difficult.

### Note: In order to view table, you must have data within it.

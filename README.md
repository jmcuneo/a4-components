## Austin Rebello A4 Components

I followed a [React tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk) to create a blank React project. I decided to implement Assignment 2 into this project for simplicity reasons, allowing me to focus more on learning React than trying to mesh React with a more complex project. The only thing I was not able to get working easily was the table automatically updating on data changes, which is why there is now a button to update the data in the table.

I would say that React both improved and hindered my development experience, though some of the hindering was my own fault, so overall I would say it improved the development experience. This is because I felt that building and implementing components to dynamically add content to the page, along with ease of styling, made developing the page mostly straightforward. I did struggle to get different components to communicate with each other (in the sense of updating data automatically), which I am certain can be solved with better use of setStates.

## Task List using Svelte

https://a4-sethfrank.onrender.com

For assignment 4, I adapted my assignment 2 project to utilize Svelte, as well as adding in some of elements from assignment 3. The main thing that was changed from assignment 2 was the use of Svelte for all of the client-end JavaScript. I also added in some of the elements from my assignment 3, including the use of Bootstrap for CSS styling and the calendar view and radios for adding a task.

Overall, I feel like the use of Svelte improved the development experience since it eliminated much of the annoying aspects of linking certain aspects of the HTML and JavaScript files together. In particular, it was very annoying before having to create all the different HTML elements within my JavaScript file, especially for the table. However, by using Svelte, it made it a lot easier to do this since you can do all directly in HTML and just add in the Svelte components for all the elements that are subject to change. The each __ as __ block was very useful too since it acts like a for loop, making the code look a lot cleaner. I also found the way to access HTML elements very easy. Since I often have to access values from the HTML elements for my form, Svelte makes it very easy since you can bind an element value to a variable and just call that variable instead of calling a function.









Assignment 4 - Components
===

For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of *either* A2 or A3 using either React or Svelte components. If you choose A3 you only need to use components for the data display / updating; you can leave your login UI as is.

[React Tutorial](https://github.com/jmcuneo/cs4241-guides/blob/master/using.react.md)  

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku, etc.). However, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them.

I used React to recreate the client side page for my A2 website, using the layout and css from my A3.
I think that the software ended up hindering the development experience, as I never really felt restricted with regular html/css/js.
I don'think I took full advantage of React, as I was unable to fully flesh out the server side of the project, however since a4 required only the client side, this was presumebly okay.

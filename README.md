I converted the previous assignment to be deployed on a React server. I had very little experience with React until now, so a major hurdle was learning what was the same and what was different from simpy using HTML. I started by going through some tutorials to get the hang of React and understand its structure. Things definitely got easier as I continued working on the assignment, as it mainly came down to figuring out what needed to be changed to get the website to work properly. I think for me personally I didn't really feel any upsides of using React for this project as opposed to what I did for assignment 3, but I do think if I were to make a completely new project from scratch, there are aspects of React I would definitely prefer.

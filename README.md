## The Worst Calculator

I used React to re-create my A2 assignment with all the same functionality.

*Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?* I believe React was a good choice for this concept of a simple (bad) calculator, but it is a little hard to judge because I knew the code for my previous assignment already. There is definitely less code overall now, which I would say is a plus. The hardest part of all of this was getting Vite to work, which I was able to do by running 'npm run dev' after a lot of trial and error.

## Car Data App
New A4 Link:

https://hanzalah416.github.io/a4-components/

Deployed on GitHub Pages for easy deployment.

In this project, I re-implemented the client-side portion of my Assignment #2 (https://a2-hanzalahqamar.glitch.me/) using React components. I converted the existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into reusable React components, such as CarForm, CarFormDialog, CarTable, and CarRow. The new technology, React, improved the development experience by providing a more organized and modular structure to the code, making it easier to manage and maintain. Overall, it made it so much easier to realize what files did what instead of looking through a very long html file or css file. I also used MaterialUI for styling, which made the CSS so much easier and straightforward because there were already prepackaged components included for forms and input boxes. I added a Pop-Up box to add new cars instead of a constantly rendered form, and also changed the styling and simplified editing car data that were already in the table due to react making it easier to do so. The server side portion was not implemented into A4 from A2 because of the assignment specifications, so instances dont stay in the website upon reload.

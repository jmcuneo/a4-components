## Taskwave - React

**Deployed at: [Render](https://a4-williamhuang.onrender.com)**

This project is the react version of the [taskwave](https://github.com/whuang214/a3-WilliamHuang) project. It is a simple task management application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. The application is built using React and Bootstrap.

### Changes

The old application was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The main change in this project is the use of React to build the application. The application is now a single page application that uses React components to render the different parts of the application. The application is now more responsive and interactive. The application now uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage the state of the application. Although the new technology was some troublesome to transition to, it will improve future development experience as React is a popular library that is widely used in the industry.

## Ordering app
Website failed to host on glitch, is able to run locally with npm run. I also could not get the app to deploy on heroku servers. 
I used react for this assignment.
React poorly integrated with my website design as there were a lot of table row editing as well as form editing. This was especially challenging and caused a lot of additional time spent trying to get the app to work as well as a lot of bad behavior and errors.
